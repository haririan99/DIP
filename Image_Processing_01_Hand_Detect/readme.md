## Hand Detection

## In this project, we want the user's hands and fingers to be automatically recognized by the computer. It uses **OpenCV and MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking.

## 🚀 Features

- ✋ **Real-time Hand Tracking** using MediaPipe  
- 🎥 **Works with Any Webcam**  

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: Uses MediaPipe to detect the hand and identify key landmarks.
